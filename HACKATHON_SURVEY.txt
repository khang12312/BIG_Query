OVERALL EXPERIENCE:
BigQuery AI has transformed our approach to data analysis and application development. The ability to perform sophisticated AI operations directly within SQL has eliminated complex data pipeline requirements and reduced development time significantly. The semantic search capabilities have opened new possibilities for intelligent applications that were previously difficult to implement at scale.

The hackathon experience has been excellent, pushing us to explore all three approaches and discover innovative ways to combine generative AI, vector search, and multimodal analysis. BigQuery AI is genuinely building the future of data analytics.
